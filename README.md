# Advent of Code 2023

Will I finally finish the Advent of Code? If it was ever going to happen, now
feels like the time. Solutions are written in Python, though if I'm feeling
motivated I may re-do them in other languages I'm interested in learning. (For
example, I redid problem 2 in Rust. For these sorts of puzzles / contests, doing
them in something that isn't Ruby or Python feels like a fools errand. I assume
there is some bad-ass Perl programmer totally crushing this game. Or some old
awk/sed expert!)
